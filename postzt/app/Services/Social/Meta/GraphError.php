/**
 * Interprets Meta Graph API (Facebook / Instagram / Threads) error responses
 * for the connection-health path (ConnectionVerifier's verify/refresh calls
 * against `/me` and `/refresh_access_token`). Does not cover the much larger,
 * platform-specific content-publishing error maps in
 * FacebookPublishException/InstagramPublishException/ThreadsPublishException.
 *
 * Meta returns rate-limit and transient failures as an ordinary HTTP 4xx with
 * type "OAuthException", so neither the HTTP status nor the error type alone
 * can tell a dead token from a throttle. Two independent rate-limit systems
 * exist and both must be treated as transient:
 *
 * - Platform Rate Limits (app/user access tokens — Instagram and Threads
 *   accounts in this app): code 4 "app rate limit", code 17 "user rate
 *   limit". https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/guides/error-handling/
 * - Business Use Case (BUC) Rate Limits (Page/system-user tokens — Facebook
 *   and InstagramFacebook accounts here use Page tokens): code 80001 "Pages
 *   API", code 80002 "Instagram Platform", and code 32 "Pages API with a User
 *   token" — which the connect flow hits, since the portfolio walk reads
 *   /me/accounts, /me/businesses and the owned_pages / client_pages edges with
 *   the user token straight from OAuth. Unlike Platform Rate Limits, BUC
 *   rejections come back as an ordinary HTTP 400, not 429. BUC also covers
 *   several other Meta products (Marketing API, WhatsApp, Messenger, ...)
 *   with their own 80000-series codes — irrelevant here since this app never
 *   calls those APIs; add a code only once we actually call the surface it
 *   belongs to, verified against the table below, not guessed.
 *   https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/rate-limiting/
 * - Generic transient upstream problems: code 1, code 2.
 *
 * Only a known transient code (or a body Meta didn't return as parseable
 * JSON at all — a WAF block page, a truncated response, a gateway hiccup —
 * which carries no confirmed rejection either) means the failure isn't a
 * confirmed rejection. Every other 4xx — including error codes other than
 * 190, which Meta also uses to signal a dead token (e.g. code 100 seen on a
 * genuinely revoked Threads token) — means the account needs to be
 * reconnected.
